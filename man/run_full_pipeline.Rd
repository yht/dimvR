\arguments{
\item{X}{Data frame/matrix of predictors (numeric).}

\item{y}{Numeric response.}

\item{task}{"regression" (placeholder for future extensions).}

\item{missing_rates}{Vector of missing rates (e.g., c(0.2, 0.4)).}

\item{mechanisms}{Vector of mechanisms ("MCAR","MAR","MNAR").}

\item{imputers}{Vector of imputer keys: c("dimv_R","mean","mice").}

\item{nsim}{Monte Carlo simulations for SHAP (fastshap).}

\item{repeats}{Repeats per configuration (currently unused).}

\item{workers}{Number of parallel workers for SHAP.}

\item{m_imp}{Number of imputations per method (Rubin pooling).}

\item{seed}{RNG seed.}
}
\value{
Data frame with pooled metrics per (method, mechanism, rate).
}
\description{
Executes an end-to-end experiment:
1) Induces missingness (MCAR/MAR/MNAR) at given rates
2) Trains reference model on complete TRAIN and computes reference SHAP on TEST
3) Imputes TRAIN/TEST via selected imputers (train-only where applicable)
4) Trains downstream model per imputation, evaluates MSE & SHAP MSE
5) Pools estimates with Rubin's rules
