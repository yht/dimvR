\title{Multiple Imputation via DIMV (Rubin-ready)}
\usage{
dimv_impute_multiple(imputer, X_new, m = 5, seed = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{imputer}{A \code{dimv_imputer} model fitted by \code{dimv_train()}.}

\item{X_new}{Data containing missing values.}

\item{m}{Number of multiply-imputed datasets to generate (default \code{5}).}

\item{seed}{Optional random seed for reproducibility.}
}
\value{
A list of \code{m} fully-imputed data frames.
}
\description{
Generates \code{m} multiply-imputed datasets using the DIMV conditional
expectations as the mean structure, and adds Gaussian noise based on
the learned residual variances. Only originally missing entries receive
stochastic noise, ensuring valid Rubin-style variance pooling.
