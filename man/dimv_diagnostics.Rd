\title{Basic diagnostics for a trained DIMV imputer}
\usage{
dimv_diagnostics(imputer, X_original, X_imputed)
}
\arguments{
\item{imputer}{A \code{dimv_imputer} object.}

\item{X_original}{The original data (with \code{NA}).}

\item{X_imputed}{The imputed data returned by \code{dimv_impute_new()}.}
}
\value{
A list with \code{iterations}, \code{adaptive}, \code{feature_select},
\code{residual_variances}, \code{diff_history}, and \code{missing_rmse}.
}
\description{
Provides a small set of diagnostics summarizing convergence, variance,
and a naive RMSE on previously-missing entries relative to column means.
Intended as a quick health check; not a replacement for downstream validation.
