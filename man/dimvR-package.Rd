\title{dimvR: Conditional Distribution-Based Imputation of Missing Values with Regularization}
\description{
Implements conditional distribution-based imputation methods for missing values with regularization techniques. Provides an end-to-end explainability pipeline with SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) interpretability and automatic HTML report generation for comprehensive imputation analysis and model transparency. Supports multiple imputation with Rubin's pooling rules for proper uncertainty quantification.
