\usage{
select_features_adaptive(
  X,
  target_var,
  min_features = 2,
  max_features = 5,
  verbose = FALSE
)
}
\description{
Selects a subset of predictor features for imputing a target variable,
using a simple adaptive correlation-based threshold. The goal is to
reduce noise and multicollinearity in the conditional models while
maintaining minimal intrusion into the DIMV framework.
