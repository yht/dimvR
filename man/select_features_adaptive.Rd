\title{Adaptive Feature Selection for DIMV (Correlation/MI/Hybrid)}
\usage{
select_features_adaptive(
  X,
  target_var,
  min_features = 2,
  max_features = 5,
  method = c("adaptive", "fixed", "mi", "hybrid"),
  threshold = NULL,

)
}
\arguments{
\item{X}{A numeric data frame or matrix.}

\item{target_var}{Target variable (name or index).}

\item{min_features}{Minimum number of features to select.}

\item{max_features}{Maximum number of features to select.}

\item{method}{Selection method: adaptive, fixed, mi, or hybrid.}

\item{threshold}{Fixed correlation threshold (for method = "fixed").}

\item{nbins}{Number of bins for MI estimation (methods "mi" and "hybrid").}

\item{verbose}{If TRUE, prints selection summary.}
}
\description{
Selects a subset of predictor features for imputing a target variable.
Supports adaptive (correlation), fixed-threshold (correlation),
mutual information, and hybrid (correlation + MI) methods.
