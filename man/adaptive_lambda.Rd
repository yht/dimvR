\title{Adaptive Lambda Recommendation (Heuristic)}
\usage{
adaptive_lambda(X)
}
\arguments{
\item{X}{A numeric data frame or matrix.}
}
\value{
A numeric recommended lambda value.

\description{
Recommends a ridge penalty (\code{lambda}) based on the median
pairwise correlation between variables. Stronger correlation and
multicollinearity imply greater regularization is needed for numerical
stability during conditional regression.
