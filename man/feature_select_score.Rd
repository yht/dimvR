\title{Feature Relevance Scoring for DIMV}
\usage{
feature_select_score(X)
}
\arguments{
\item{X}{A numeric data frame or matrix.}
}
\value{
A data frame with:
\itemize{
  \item \code{feature}: feature/column name
  \item \code{score}: relevance score (higher = more important)
}
}
\description{
Computes a simple multivariate relevance score for each feature using
the mean absolute correlation with all other variables. Higher scores
indicate a stronger contribution to the covariance structure, making
the feature more informative for conditional imputation.
