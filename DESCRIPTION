Description: Implements conditional distribution-based imputation methods for 
    missing values with regularization techniques. Provides an end-to-end 
    explainability pipeline with SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) 
    interpretability and automatic HTML report generation for comprehensive 
    imputation analysis and model transparency. Supports multiple imputation 
    with Rubin's pooling rules for proper uncertainty quantification.
